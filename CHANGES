This source of lua 4.0.1 has undergone changes which add/remove feature(s).
These changes are listed below:
1. src/llex.c: read_number() -- add support for parsing hexadecimal constants
2. src/lvm.c: luaV_settable() -- members prefixed with a _(underscore) are assumed to be private and cannot be assigned to except in the table constructor
3. src/lvm.c: luaV_settable() -- native code can assign to any field whether private or not
4. src/lvm.c: luaV_settable() -- introduced some degree of static typing by checking if type of new value equals that of old value
5. src/lvm.c: luaV_setglobal() -- same as above
6. src/lvm.c: luaV_execute() -- modified OP_SETGLOBAL to type check before assignment
